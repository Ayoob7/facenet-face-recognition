# Face Recognition System

This application can be fully accessed from my GitHub repository (https://github.com/Ayoob7/facenet-face-recognition)

This is the research product of the thesis ifold Learning of Latent Space Vectors in GAN for Image Synthesis. This has an application to the research, name a facial recognition system. The application was developed by consulting the FaceNet model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf).
## How to use

Install project requirements

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Run this in the root dir to launch the application.

	python Dashboard.py

This has a extensible, user operable facial recognition application.However, there are limitations with it as well. Anyone wishing to work on the limitations are welcome to do so.

1. Desktop GPU support for CUDA versions > 9.2
2. Python libraries such as Numba and Cython. ()
3. Facilitate FPGA model loading, for IOT applications. (Model Compression)
4. Make an ubiquitous network message broker (Like RabbitMQ) for IOT applications
